            <h1>Basics of Internet:</h1>
            <p>
                The Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices, 
                allowing people to share information, communicate, and access resources from anywhere in the world. 
                It has revolutionized the way we learn, work, and interact, making information and services easily 
                accessible to everyone.

                            <h3>Principle 1: The Need to Share Information</h3>
                            <p>
                                The most fundamental truth is that we have information on one computer 
                                <b>(Computer A)</b>and we want it to be on another computer <b>(Computer B)</b>. 
                                These computers are not in the same room. How do we solve this? The simplest, 
                                most primitive way is to physically carry the information <b>(e.g., on a USB stick)</b>. 
                                This works, but it's slow and doesn't scale. We need a direct, electronic connection.
                                So, we run a cable <b>(like an ethernet cable or a fiber optic line)</b> between 
                                <b>Computer A and Computer B</b>. We can now send electrical signals or pulses of 
                                light down this cable. We can agree on a simple code: a high-voltage signal means 
                                <b>"1,"</b> and a low-voltage signal means <b>"0."</b> We have just created the most 
                                basic form of a network: a direct link. We can now send bits <b>(1s and 0s)</b> 
                                between two computers.

                            <h3>Principle 2: The Problem of Scale:</h3>
                            <p>
                                This works for two computers. But what if we have <b>three computers (A, B, and C)</b> 
                                and they all need to talk to each other? We would need a cable <b>from A to B, 
                                from B to C, and from A to C</b>. For four computers, we'd need six cables. 
                                For 100 computers,<b> we'd need 4,950 cables</b>. This is a failure of scale. 
                                Connecting every machine to every other machine directly is physically impossible.
                                The logical solution is to have a central device. Every computer connects to this 
                                one central point <b>(let's call it a Switch)</b>. When Computer A wants to talk to 
                                Computer C, it sends the message to the switch, and the switch forwards it only 
                                to Computer C. We have just invented a Local Network. A group of computers in close 
                                proximity <b>(like an office or a home)</b> can now communicate efficiently.

                            <h3>Principle 3: The Problem of Connecting Networks</h3>
                            <p>
                                Now, our office has a local network. Another office across town also has its own 
                                local network. How does a computer on our network talk to a computer on their network?
                                We face the same scaling problem. We can't run a wire from every computer in our 
                                office to every computer in theirs. The logical solution is to connect the networks 
                                themselves. We need a special, dedicated computer that is connected to our network 
                                and also connected to their network. Its only job is to pass messages, or 
                                <b>"route"</b> traffic, from one network to the other. Let's call this device a 
                                Router. Now, if we want to connect to a third network, we just connect our router 
                                to their router. Suddenly, we can build a massive, sprawling web by connecting networks 
                                to other networks. This is the fundamental truth of the Internet. The Internet is a 
                                "network of networks." It is not one giant cloud; it is millions of private and public 
                                local networks all connected by these special routing devices.

                            <h3>Principle 4: The Problem of Finding Anyone (Addressing)</h3>
                            <p>
                                We have built a global web of interconnected networks. If I'm on my computer in my office, 
                                how do I send a message to a specific server in another country? There are millions of 
                                computers. I need a unique address for every single device. This gives rise to the need 
                                for a universal addressing system. Just like the postal service needs a unique street 
                                address for every house in the world, our network of networks needs a unique address 
                                for every connected device.
                                This is the reason the <b>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)</b> exists. It's a unique 
                                label <b>(e.g., 142.250.184.142)</b> assigned to each device. When a router sees a 
                                message, it looks at the destination IP address and says, "Based on this address, 
                                I don't need to send it to the network on my left; I need to send it to the network 
                                on my right to get it one step closer to its final destination." Routers don't know 
                                the full path; they just know the next best "hop" to send the message on.

                            <h3>Principle 5: The Problem of Reliability and Fairness</h3>
                            <p>
                                If I want to send a large file, like a 1-hour video, it is a huge stream of data. If I try to 
                                send it all at once:
                                <br>
                                1. I would completely monopolize the connection, and no one else could send anything until my 
                                video was done.
                                <br>
                                2. If even a single bit of information gets corrupted during the transfer, the entire file is 
                                ruined, and I have to start over from the beginning.
                                <br>
                                This is inefficient and unreliable. The logical solution is to break the large file into many 
                                thousands of small, numbered pieces. Let's call them <b>Packets</b>. Each packet is like a tiny 
                                envelope. It contains:
                                <br>
                                - <b>A small piece of the data (a "payload")</b>.
                                <br>
                                - <b>The destination IP address (where it's going)</b>.
                                <br>
                                - <b>The sender's IP address (so they can reply)</b>.
                                <br>
                                - A number, so the receiving computer knows how to reassemble them in the correct order 
                                <b>("Packet 1 of 5,000," "Packet 2 of 5,000," etc.)</b>.
                                <br>
                                These packets can travel independently across the internet, sometimes even taking different routes. 
                                The receiving computer gathers all the packets, checks if any are missing <b>(and requests them again if they are)</b>, 
                                and reassembles them in the correct order to recreate the original file.
                                This system of rules for addressing, breaking down, sending, and reassembling data is called a Protocol. 
                                The main one used on the internet is <b>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)</b>.

                <p>
                    So, the internet isn't magic. It's a series of logical solutions to a series of fundamental problems:
                    <br>
                    1. Problem: Share data between two computers. Solution: A direct physical link.
                    <br>
                    2. Problem: Connect many computers efficiently. Solution: A local network with a central switch.
                    <br>
                    3. Problem: Connect many networks efficiently. Solution: An internetwork connected by routers.
                    <br>
                    4. Problem: Find a specific computer in this massive web. Solution: A universal IP Address for every device.
                    <br>
                    5. Problem: Send data reliably and fairly without errors. Solution: A set of rules (TCP/IP) to break data into small, addressed packets that can be reassembled.

                    - <b>Structure:</b> It's a 32-bit number. To make it readable for humans, we divide it into four 8-bit sections, 
                    and write each section as a decimal number from 0 to 255.
                    <br>
                    - Example: <b>172.217.16.142</b> (one of Google's addresses)
                    <br>
                    - <b>The Big Problem (The Why)</b>: A 32-bit number means there's a hard limit on the total number of 
                    possible addresses: 2^32, which is about <b>4.3 billion</b>.

                was to solve the address exhaustion problem of IPv4. The fundamental difference is the size of the address:
                <br>
                - IPv4: Uses a <b>32-bit</b> address, giving us ~4.3 billion unique addresses.
                <br>
                - IPv6: Uses a <b>128-bit</b> address.
                <br>
                The difference between <b>32-bit and 128-bit is not 4x. It's an exponential leap that is difficult to comprehend</b>.
                <br><br>
                <b>The number of possible IPv6 addresses is 2^128, which is roughly:</b>
                <b>340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000</b> (340 undecillion)
            </p>

                <h2>What Does an IPv6 Address Look Like?</h2>
                <p>
                    Because it's so long, the format is different. It uses <b>hexadecimal</b> 
                    <b>(numbers 0-9 and letters a-f)</b> instead of just decimal numbers.
                    <br>
                    An example of a full IPv6 address:
                    <br>
                    <b>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</b>
                    <br>
                    It's broken down into:
                    <br>
                    - Eight groups of four hexadecimal characters.
                    - The groups are separated by colons (:).

                <h2>MAC Address:</h2>
                <p>
                    A <b>MAC (Media Access Control) Address</b> is a unique, permanent serial number burned into every 
                    network-capable piece of hardware (your laptop's Wi-Fi card, your phone, your smart TV, the network 
                    port on your desktop).

                <br>
                <p>
                    A MAC address is a <b>48-bit</b> number. To make it readable for humans, it's typically written as 
                    <b>12 hexadecimal digits</b>. The most common ways you'll see it displayed are:
                </p>

                    <li><b>Colon-Separated (Most Common):</b> <b>3C:22:FB:A3:B4:C5</b></li>

                <h2>Port Number</h2>
                <p>
                    Port numbers are <b>numerical identifiers (0-65535)</b> in computer networking that identify specific 
                    applications or services on a device. They work with IP addresses to direct network traffic to 
                    the correct service on a machine, with common ports assigned to standard applications like HTTP 
                    (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
                    <br>
                    A port number is a <b>16-bit unsigned integer</b>. Because it's a 16-bit number, the total number of 
                    possible ports is 2^16, which equals <b>65,536</b>.

                    These ports are for specific applications or services that are not as universal as the "well-known" ones. 
                    Companies and developers can register a port for their software to avoid conflicts with other applications.

                    These ports are not meant for public-facing servers. Their job is completely different.

                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> When a client (e.g., your browser) makes a request, the operating system assigns a temporary 
                    source port from this range for the duration of that single connection.</li>
                    <li><b>Key Takeaway:</b> You never configure your server applications to listen on these ports. They are used automatically

                <p>
                    DNS is the global, distributed system that translates the human-friendly domain names into the computer-friendly 
                    IP addresses. Without it, you'd have to memorize hundreds of IP addresses to browse the web.

                <h3>Step 1: Checking the Local Cache (Do I already know this?)</h3>
                <p>
                    Before your computer does any work, it checks if it already has the answer. Speed is everything. It checks in this order:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Browser Cache:</b> The browser itself keeps a short-term memory of recently visited websites.</li>
                    <li><b>Operating System (OS) Cache:</b> If the browser doesn't have it, your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux) also has a cache.</li>
                    <li><b>Router Cache:</b> Some routers also maintain their own DNS cache.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If the IP address is found in any of these caches, the process stops here, and your browser immediately connects 
                    to the IP address. This is why websites you visit often load so quickly.

                <h3>Step 2: The Recursive Resolver (Asking for Help)</h3>
                <p>
                    If the answer isn't in any local cache, your computer needs to ask for help. It sends a query to its configured 
                    <b>Recursive DNS Resolver</b>. This is usually a server run by your <b>ISP</b> or a public one like Google's (8.8.8.8).

                <h3>Step 3: The Hierarchical Search (The Global Phonebook)</h3>
                <p>
                    The Recursive Resolver doesn't know every IP address in the world. Instead, it knows how to navigate the global 
                    DNS system, which is a giant, hierarchical tree. It starts from the top and works its way down.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>The Root Servers:</b> The resolver first asks one of the 13 logical Root Servers where to find the servers that manage the <b>.com</b> domain.</li>
                    <li><b>The TLD Servers:</b> The resolver then asks one of the <b>Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers</b> for <b>.com</b> where to find the servers for <b>google.com</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>The Authoritative Name Server:</b> This is the final step. The resolver asks one of Google's own <b>Authoritative Name Servers</b> for the final IP address.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Step 4: The Journey Back</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Authoritative Server sends the IP address back to the Recursive Resolver.</li>
                    <li>The Recursive Resolver saves (caches) this answer for a period of time.</li>
                    <li>The Recursive Resolver sends the IP address back to your computer.</li>
                    <li>Your OS gives the IP to your browser.</li>

                <h3>Step 5: The Final Connection</h3>
                <p>
                    Now, your browser has the IP address it needs. It can now open a direct connection to 
                    the IP address on port 443 (for HTTPS) and say, "Please send me the webpage."
