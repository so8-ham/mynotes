                <h2>1. What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the basic structure for web pages by using elements and tags to organize content such as text, images, links, and more. HTML is easy to learn and essential for anyone interested in creating websites or web applications.</p>

                <h2>2. Is HTML case-sensitive?</h2>
                <p>No, HTML is not case-sensitive. This means that tags and attributes can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a combination of both, and they will be interpreted the same way by the browser. However, **using all lowercase is considered a best practice** for consistency and readability.</p>
